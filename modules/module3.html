<h1>Embedded Systems [III]<br>Arduino IDE and prrogramming ESP32</h1>
<p>Arduino IDE is an intergrated development environment for programming Arduino boards.<br>Its a powerful micro-controller module and versatile tool that makes it easy to create and program interactive electronic projects.</p>

 <p>ESP32 is a highly capable microcontroller with a wide range of features and capabilities such as<br>dual cores,low power consumption and compatibility with development frameworks which makes it a preffered choice for IoT applications.</p>

<p>The ESP32 is programmed using the Arduino IDE which involves installing the IDE, adding support for the ESP32 board,<br>selecting the appropriate board variant, connecting the ESP32 to your computer, writing a code in the Arduino IDE<br>and uploading it to the board.</p>
