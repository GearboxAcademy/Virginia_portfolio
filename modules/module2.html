<h1>Electronic circuit</h1>
<p> its a complete circular path that electricity flows through.it directs and controls electric current to perform various functions.
    It consists of components such as trasistors, diodes, resistors,inductors and capacitors, which aid in signal amplification,<br>computing and data transfer.
<br>A circuit has three major components: <br>a conductive path- a pathway for current to pass through...wire
                                          <br>a source of power (battery)
                                          <br>a load- e.g a lamp that needs electric power to operate 

Sensor- a device that detect/ senses physical phenomenon then reacts to it in a particular way.<br>
      converts physical attributes to electric signal.
      
Actuator- converts electric signals to physical action.</p>
