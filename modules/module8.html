<h1>CCTV and IP CAMERA APPLICATIONS II</h1>
<p>CCTV- Closed Circuit Television.<br>Transmits video footage over a single channel essentially creating a closed circuit.They are used for security monitoring and surveillance.<br>Basic components of a CCTV system are:</p>
                     <p>*Security Cameras<br>
                        *Cabling / Wiring<br>
                        *Network Video Record Recorder (NVR)<br>
                        *Storage (Hard Drives) </p>
<h2>IP Cameras</h2>
<p>Also known as network cameras and use ethernet cables.<br>They provide better image quality and are compatible with many features.<br>(NVR)Network Video Recorder allows you to record and store clips on a hard drive, snap images, and transmit them to your computer or remote device for live and recorded viewing.</p>
<h3>Analog cameras</h3>
<p>They require more cabling than ip cameras and use coaxial cables which offers reliability.<br>Has an external recoder known as a Digita Video Recorder(DVR)that converts analog signals to digital format for local recording and remote access.</p>
<p>Types of cctv cameras:</p>
                    <p>.Bullet Cameras<br>

                    <p>.Dome Cameras<br>

                    <p>.Turret Cameras<br>

                    <p>.PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom)<br>
                       <img src="../images/ptz.jpg" width="300" height="200"></p>

<h4>Classful IP Addressing</h4>
<p>An IP address is an address having information about how to reach a specific host, especially outside the LAN. An IP address is a 32-bit unique address.<br>Generally, there are two notations in which the IP address is written: dotted decimal notation and hexadecimal notation.</p>

<h5>Classful addressing</h5>
<p>The 32-bit IP address is divided into five sub-classes.</p>
                    <p> Class A- are assigned to the networks that contain a large number of hosts.<br>  
                        Class B- is assigned to networks that range from medium to large-sized networks.<br>
                        Class C- assigned to small-sized networks.<br>
                        Class D- is reserved for multi-casting.<br>
                        Class E- reserved for experimental and research purposes </p>

<h6>Designing a CCTV system</h6>
<p>On this project we used:<br>1.2MP Ip cameras(Dome and Bullet) Hik-vision brand<br>2.a 4 channel NVR<br>3.LAN cables<br>4.RJ45 connector<br>5.Display(monitor) and a smartphone(for live streaming from another location)</p>
<p>The camera is connected to the NVR using network cables and in turn the camera recieves power and transmits data.</p>
