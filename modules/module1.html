<h1>Introduction To Embedded Systems</h1>
<p> Embedded systems:refers to a computer system designed to perform a specific task or function.</p>
    
    
     Raspberry pi pico:  a micro-controller board used in a widerange of applications and contains GPIO pins <br>which can be used to control and recieve inputs from electronic devices.
        <br>The Raspberry Pi Pico's MCU processes incoming data and commands, and then uses its GPIO pins to control external devices and sensors.<br>

       Overview of RPI PICO and Gpio pins :

        <p>Thonny IDE an integrated development environment (IDE) which supports multiple programming languages like python,<br> comes with a pre-installed micro-python support that is used to program raspberry pi pico.</p>

    <p>The pico has an in-built LED connected to GPIO25 hence is the only pin that can be used to control and blink the internal LED.</p>
    

    <p>Blinking pico LED with micropython.</p>
    <code>from machine import Pin
        from time import sleep
        
        led = Pin(25,Pin.OUT)
        
        while True:
            led.toggle()
            sleep(2)</code>
