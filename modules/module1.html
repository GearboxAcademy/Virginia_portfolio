<h1>Embedded systems</h1>
<p> refers to a computer system designed to perform a specific task or function.</p>
    
    
    <p style="color:violet;"> Raspberry pi pico: <br> a micro-controller board used in a widerange of <br> applications and contains GPIO pins which can be used to control and recieve inputs from electronic devices.
        <br>The Raspberry Pi Pico's MCU processes incoming data and commands, and then uses its GPIO pins to control external devices and sensors.<br>Thonny IDE an integrated development environment (IDE) which supports <br> multiple programming languages like python, comes with a pre-installed micro-python support that is used to program raspberry pi pico.</p>
    
    <p>The pico has an in-built LED connected to GPIO25 hence is the only pin that can be used to control and blink the internal LED.</p>
