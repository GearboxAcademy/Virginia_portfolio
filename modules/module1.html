<h1>Introduction To Embedded Systems</h1>

<p>An <b>Embedded system</b> refers to a computer system designed to perform a specific task or function.</p>
    
    
     <p><b>Raspberry pi pico</b>:a micro-controller board used in a widerange of applications and contains GPIO pins <br>which can be used to control and recieve inputs from electronic devices.
        <br>The Raspberry Pi Pico's MCU processes incoming data and commands, and then uses its GPIO pins to control external devices and sensors.<br>

       <p><b>Overview of RPI PICO and Gpio pins:</b></p>

        <p>The pico has an in-built LED connected to GPIO25 hence is the only pin that can be used to control and blink the internal LED.</p>
    
     <p><b>Thonny IDE </b>is an integrated development environment (IDE) which supports multiple programming languages like python,<br> comes with a pre-installed micro-python support that is used to program raspberry pi pico.<br></p>


    <p><b>Blinking pico LED with micropython.</b></p>
    <code>from machine import Pin<br>
        from time import sleep
        
   <p>led = Pin(25,Pin.OUT)</p>

 <p>while True:<br>  
  led.toggle()<br>
  sleep(2)<br></code></p>
