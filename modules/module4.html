<h1>Microcontroller Programming and Access Control Systems</h1>
<p><b>Communication protocols</b></p>

<p><b>I2c</b> {Inter-intergrated circuit} its a communication protocol that allows multiple electronic devices to<br> communicate with each other using a serial interface.</p>

<p>I2C protocol uses two wires: the SDA(serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line) to facilitate communication.<br> SDA is used for transmitting and receiving data, while SCL is used to synchronize the data transfer between devices.</p>
<p>It supports multi-master and multi-slave communication where the master device initiates communication<br>and the slave acts responds to the master's commands</p>
