<h1>Microcontroller Programming and Access Control Systems</h1>
<p><b>Communication protocols</b></p>

<p><b>I2c</b> {Inter-intergrated circuit} its a communication protocol that allows multiple electronic devices to<br> communicate with each other using a serial interface.</p>

<p>I2C protocol uses two wires: the SDA(serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line) to facilitate communication.<br> SDA is used for transmitting and receiving data, while SCL is used  data transfer between devices.</p>
<p>It supports multi-master and multi-slave communication where the master device initiates communication<br>and the slave acts/responds to the master's commands</p>
<p>Has 2 different kinds of ids: <br>I2c1 <br>I2c0</p>

<p>Also it reduces the amout of pinouts required for communication.</p>

<p><b>UART</b>is short for Universal Asynchronus Reciever/Transmitter. </p>
<p>it defines a protocol or set of rules for exchanging serial data between 2 devices. </p>
<p>main purpose is to transmit and recieve serial data and does not rely on an external clock.</p>

<p>UART is a stand alone ic or physical circuit in a micro-controller.</p>
<p>It is ideal for lowpower and long distance communication and it is <b> NOT</b> a protocol.</p>

<p><b>SPI</b> Serial Periphal Interface</p>
<p>Sends data between a micro-controller and 1 or more intergrated circuit</p>
<p>it is full duplex (data is transmitted and recieved at the same time in high speed)</p>
<p>it is a single master and multi-slave type of communication where each slave has a (ss)slave select line which is used for selecting the desired slave for communication.</p>
<p>it is synchronus therefore it relies on an external clock.</p>
