<h1>ASSET TRACKING</h1>
<h2>GPS{Global Positioning system}</h2>
<p>Its a space-based satelite navigation system provides location and time information.<br>GPS receivers are mostly used for navigation, positioning, time dissemination, and other research purposes.<br>The receiver converts the received signals into position and estimates the time and some other useful information depending on the application and requirements.</p>
    
<img src="../images/gps explained.jpg" width="300" height="200">
<p>GPS determines the distance between a satelite and GPSreciever by calculating the time taken by the radio signal to travel from a satelite to the reciever.</p>
<h3>GPS PROTOCOLS</h3>
     <p>1.NMEA 0183<br>
          It is commonly used in marine applications.</p>
     <p>2.TSIP {Trimble Starndard Interface Protocol}<br>
          Allows the designer toconfigure and control GPS reciever for optimal performance.</p>
     <p>TAIP {Trimble ASCII Interface Protocol}<br>
          Its a bidirectional protocol which uses ASCI commands and designed specifically for vehicle tracking applications </p>
